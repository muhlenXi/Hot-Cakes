### Head First Design Pattern

> 

#### Design Principle

- Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same. 

- Program to an interface, not an implementation.

- Favor composition over inheritance. 

- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact. 

- Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

- Depend upon abstraction. Do not depend upon concrete classes.

- Principle of Least Knowledge-talk only to your immediate friends.

- Don't call us, we'll call you.

- A class should have only one reason to change.

#### SOLID

##### Single responsibility principle

> A class or modules should have one, and only one, reason to be changed.

##### Open closed principle

> Software entities(classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

##### Liskov substitution principle

> Objects should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.

##### Interface segregation principle

> Clients should not be forced to depend on methods that they do not use.

#####  Dependency Inversion principle

> A. High level modules should not depend upon low level modules. Both should depend upon abstractions.
> 
> B. Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.
